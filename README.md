Weather Dashboard is a weather forecast website which displays current, as well as a five-day forecast for
any city searched through the search bar. Search criteria displays results and also stores the city searched into a search history. Upon either searching a city, or selecting a city from the search history, any results which were previously displayed, are replaced by results from the current selection.

## API's

This project utilized API's three times over. DOM API's, third party API's, as well as a server side API. A minimal amount of hard coded HTML and CSS allowed me to dynamically create needed content with Javascript to interact with the DOM. Usage of a CSS library was incorporated and an open source server side API for the weather data.

## Technologies Used

- Web API methods
- Bootstrap
- Openweather API
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

## Challenges

This was an enjoyable project, from the get go I felt as if I had a sense of direction for how to proceed. It was however not without it's challenges. Having to rely on a seperate entities documentation to accomplish your end results can certainly put you to task. The Openweather docs are fairly well written, after significant time researching the docs, I did have to resort to googling a couple issues to see how other developers had already resolved those same things. For example, I had to search for the proper image url path that Openweather uses to insert icon codes into so that I could display icons representing various weather conditions.

## Conclusions

Study third party docs!  Pay attention to detail!  It took me a couple of minutes to figure out I needed two different endpoints, and thus two different http requests to get current weather data and 5 day forecast data.  These lessons learned now can save time on larger projects in the future.
